      <p class="section-text">
        We're <strong>You Swine</strong>, a DIY punk rock band hailing from
        Gainesville, Florida. With deep roots in the local scene and a shared
        love of loud music and raucous drums, we write all our songs
        together as a group. Our first EP captures the intensity
        and honesty that drives us. Raw riffs, fast drums and lyrics that
        confront the world head on. We stand firmly against hate and
        intolerance and believe punk rock should always be a space for
        everyone.

  <section id="about-note" class="section about">
    <div class="container">
      <h2 class="section-title">This is not a manifesto</h2>
      <p class="muted-text-section">
        Wait, punk is for everyone? Like, everyone-everyone?
        Even the ignorant fools deluted by the few owners of media orgs,
        or by Zuck's marketing algorithms and parroting talking heads squaking,
        "deport the illegals"? We believe these people are not worth fighting.
        These people are weak and afraid, like wet cats
        huddled under a tire on a rainy winter day and lashing out with claws in
        fear as you try to help. We believe that only the solidarity of all people
        will save us from corporate oligarchy and there is little hope without
        tolerance and compassion. So don't be like that pig & presidential
        pedo-in-chief and his sycophants, stooping so low down that you get
        covered in shit as you sling mud, calling a poor uneducated person "the enemy"
        just because they wear a red hat or are afflicted by lead poisioning or a syphalitic brain. Think bigger. The
        enemy and the tools they use are are one in the same and spread like a cancer.<br /> The enemy is hate. The
        enemy is greed. The enemy is ignorance.
        And the enemy is seeking to enslave
        your choices, your mind, and your body. That starts with division of community by hate with no redemption. Be
        kind.
        Although it is comprised of people
        accumulating wealth by leveraging power, the oligarchy is not a people, it's
        a function of our collective choices. So our goal must be to unify, in spite of
        our baser instincts, so that cutting out the malignancy of greed is surgical,
        not violent. That being said, if history tells us anything, it's saying that this
        must be done with a blade. We want that to be a scalple, not a shiv. This rant of not-so-radical opinions has
        gone on
        long enough and I'm reading it back like "yeah no shit, everybody knows this." but, its worth a reminder and
        hard to publish anything without saying: The corporate oligarchy used money to influence
        rulings like Citizens United to userp power from
        the State, which was once controlled by people who defined the State and the Senate as necessitating conrol by
        'the people' in a constitution. It was the
        solidarity of consensus by 'the people' which gave the authority to grant the State a monopoly on violence.
        Without that, cops are nothing but foot soldiers of the oligarchy. Fuck the Police and fuck ICE.
